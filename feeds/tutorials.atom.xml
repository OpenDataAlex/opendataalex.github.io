&lt;p&gt;If you've known me for any length of time, you know my love of and heavy use of open source.  Rarely though I'll
find tools that aren't pure open source that are quite worthwhile to have in the toolbox.  For a long time, my main
go-to data integration tool has been &lt;a href="https://help.pentaho.com/Documentation/9.0/Products/Pentaho_Data_Integration"&gt;Pentaho's Data Integration&lt;/a&gt; 
(aka Kettle aka &lt;a href="https://incubator.apache.org/clutch/hop.html"&gt;Apache Hop&lt;/a&gt;).  Another long time member of the Kettle
community (@slawo) has been working for the past year on a new modern data integration tool called &lt;a href="https://tweakstreet.io/"&gt;Tweakstreet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Tweakstreet exclusively for the past few months to really kick the tires and have to say it's an
awesome tool and coming along (and I would argue, surpassing) feature parity with many of the other big name data integration
tools including Kettle.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be adding some blog posts with some tips and tricks I've hit that may be helpful for others who want to start playing around with it.
Go ahead and check it out - there's a &lt;a href="https://tweakstreet.io/download"&gt;unlimited trial&lt;/a&gt; going on now and if you do go
for a license, they are quite reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Open Source backing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another factor about Tweakstreet that I'll mention here is &lt;a href="https://twineworks.github.io/tweakflow/index.html"&gt;Tweakflow&lt;/a&gt;,
an open source embeddable scripting language for JVM and used in Tweakstreet.  This can be used in other tools and is pretty
powerful on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Tutorials"></category><category term="Tweakstreet"></category><category term="data integration"></category></entry></feed>
